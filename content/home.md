My name is Freya Brown and I am an artist that specialises in the use of biro/ballpoint pens to create both hyper-realistic portraits and my own creative designs.

I began art from a very young age and it has been my passion ever since. I have dabbled in a lot of mediums during this time, but began working predominantly with biro around 4 years ago. I have since completed commissions for various clients as well as creating my own worlds and drawings with just the use of a Bic ballpoint pen or a combination of ink and digital techniques.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy my work.
