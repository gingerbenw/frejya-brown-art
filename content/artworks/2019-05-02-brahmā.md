This piece was drawn as a submission entry for a local art exhibition.

The theme is ‘Here Rolls the Sea’ based on a quote by Rabindranath Tagore:

“Lead me across; For here rolls the sea, and even here lies the other shore waiting to be reached – yes, here is this everlasting present, not distant, not anywhere else”

My drawing represents Brahmā, the Hindu god of creation. I wanted to create a piece that demonstrates how Brahmā is not the external object in which many seek as part of other religions or beliefs, but is a higher power that is within us, a part of us and everything that we sense within our universe.
